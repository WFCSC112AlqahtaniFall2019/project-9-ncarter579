Neither SelectionSort or BubbleSort are fast sorting algorithms. Selection sort works by treating the list as two diffrent elements, a sorted section and an unsorted section. It then selects the proper value from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part. Bubblesort works by going through the entirity of the list and swapping elements next to one another if they are out of order. BubbleSort works best when the list is already in order and takes longest when it has to make the maximum amount of swaps. Selection Sort is useful when there are memory constraints and when the list is relativly short. Selection Sort isn't useful when the list is large.
